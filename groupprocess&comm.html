				  <p> Throughout the whole process of assignment 3, the group worked well together and had faced few issues. The biggest issue that we dealt with was communication issues because one of the members attended class once and during group discussions, he was barely active due to him being unavailable to meet the group directly. Although he contributed a lot of work for his part, it still interfered with our progress. Aside from that issue, our schedules would clash thus it was not as easy to find an agreement to meet everyone on the same day. However, google docs and GitHub allowed us to do work simultaneously. This allows us to do peer review and check for errors in each other’s work. By doing that, the work produce was at a better quality. Other than that, we also used messenger call which allows smooth communication without seeing each other face-to-face. After experiencing what a group project was and examining the work done, we decided to change a few things for assignment 3.  </p>
				  <p> In github, there was a tool called audit trail which allowed us to observe the work done by which member. Unfortunately, we had a late start on github and only Edmund, Jamarl and Jason  were available to edit github as Akash and Oliver were preoccupied with other matters. </p>
				  <p> We are planning to change our group’s project idea into a cloud computing service that is targeted at the work industry only that will be called “Cloud 1” because the previous project idea that we implemented may not suffice for it to be very detailed. The idea can be explored further, however it may seem repetitive because it is quite similar to other service applications such as Uber, DiDi, Grab, etc. Other than that, we are aiming to have more group meetings where we can solve and discuss our problems. Our project idea is a cloud storage application in the form of a web application, that works in a similar way to Google Drive, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, etc. However, the target users will be users from the working industry, whereas other popular cloud storage applications provide their services for users of all age, thus having more than one target group. </p>
