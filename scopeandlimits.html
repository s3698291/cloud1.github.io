				<p> Cybersecurity is the protection of internet connected system and it includes hardware, software and data from cyber attacks. Our world is like global village and cyberspace allows the countries to stand together. Technologies are increasing day by day and cybercrimes are also increasing. To face all these cyber attacks and issues there is an immediate need for all organisations to have a strong and secured cyber system. Since the cyberspace is a common platform which can be accessed by anyone from anywhere in the world the scope of cybersecurity is equally spread throughout the world. The need of hiring professionals is increasing day by day. Organisations like cyber forensics, biometrics, cyber laws, ethical hacking, cyber security management are hiring professionals to secure their system. It is one of the most rewarding fields since in the current scenario there is a huge demand for professionals in various fields of cyber security. Many institutes are also offering full time or online courses due to the demand in job industry. Cyber security is a very enormous field with numerous subdivision as a result one candidate has several number of options to choose from. </p>
          			<p> Just like every other plans, our plan has limits to it as well. There will always be a way for hackers to hack through a system, itâ€™s only a matter of time. No matter how low the possibility is, it is still possible for hackers to breach the system of Cloud 1 and sabotage the data stored in it. Other than security limitations, there will be some limitations on upload speed. The larger the data size, the longer time it will take to upload the data onto the cloud. Unfortunately, our cloud storage services only allow users to store a finite amount of data. However, if the users want to increase their storage space, they will be able to purchase more. Lastly, this limitations will only affect users that have data caps on their internet. This will mean that users are allowed to a maximum amount of data transfer in a month that is agreed upon charged. This limitation might not affect our target users, because businesses usually uses internet with no data caps or high data caps. </p>
