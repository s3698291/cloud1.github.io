					<h1> Akash </h1>
				<p> 	My name is S M Akash, 20 years old, I am from Bangladesh which is very small and densely populated country.</br>  
					I came to Australia to do my Bachelor of Mechanical Engineering in RMIT (s3669349). I am not from any IT background.</br> 
					So, I don’t know much about IT. But I learnt a lot of it after doing assignment 1 and 2 of this course.</br> 
					I want to learn new skills this is why I chose this subject as my elective. I like boxing, road trips, soccer as my hobby.</br> 
					I also have an interest in cars, bikes I mean in automotive sectors. And I believe, hard work can beat talent.</br> 
					So, working hard every day to develop myself.</br>
 				</p>
          				<h1> Edmund </h1>
				<p> 	My name is Edmund Tan, currently 18 years old and “Life is short so go big, so wild and eat” </br> 
					is the wisest philosophy I ever thought of in my entire life but it changed to “Diamonds form under pressure”</br> 
					after experiencing University. My hobbies are playing badminton and card games with my friends.</br>  
					I came from Malaysia to study Bachelor of Technology in RMIT and this is my student number, s3698291.</br> 
					After 12 weeks of learning in university, I am fairly proficient in GitHub and eclipse now.</br> 
					Other than that, I know the basics of Java language in programming.</br> 
					I can also make application prototypes using invision and proto.io. As for my interest in IT, I would say that</br> 
					I’m interested In learning cloud computing and robotics because they are both interesting and have the potential</br> 
					to contribute to society.</br>
				</p>
					<h1> Jason </h1>
				<p> 	 My name is Jason Theodore, 18 years old and I was born and raised in Jakarta, Indonesia. I came to Australia to take Bachelor of Information Technology</br> 
					in RMIT and my student number is s3730387. Some of my hobbies include playing video games, badminton, and reading novels.</br> 
					Coming from a different culture, I grew up as an introverted person in Indonesia. However, since coming to Australia, I began to slowly</br> 
					step out of my comfort zone to meet new people. I do not have any proper IT experience before and I am eager to learn new skills. My interest</br> 
					in IT is programming and security in computing and IT. Programming always seemed like an interesting activity before I even got the chance to</br> 
					properly study it and I don't intend to stop learning and finding more ways to improve. Although I have not started learning security in computing</br> 
					and IT, it seems to be an important field of work that stands out in the IT industry. Since there has been an increase in cyber attacks around the</br> 
					world, the job prospect would definitely seem more valuable and it gives a chance for people to help society.</br>
				</p>
					<h1> Jamarl </h1>
				<p> 	My name is Jamarl Sarry, student number 3650536, born and raised in Wewak, a small town north of Papua New Guinea. Papua New Guinea is a very culturally diverse country,</br> 
					we have the people from the islands, the coastal region of the mainland and the people of the Highlands and we have 800 different languages.</br> 
					Fun fact, I am a very adventurous person, who is always up for road trips, camping and travelling to different places and experiencing different</br> 
					cultures. My favourite sport when growing up includes football and rugby but as I grew older I lost interests in football and got more involved</br> 
					in rugby, rugby has taught me how to be a team player, a skill that is very essential to date. I am mostly interested in Programming, security</br> 
					in computing, cloud computing and Web development. I think IT is a very broad program, there is more to it than we know, we live in a technological</br> 
					age, where everything around us is changing to digital that is why my interest in IT occurred because I want to be part of that change and contribute</br>
					to a better technological future.</br>
				 </p>
					<h1> Oliver </h1>
				<p> 	Hi! My name is Oliver Le, my student ID number is S3745987. As my surname suggested, I am Vietnamese, and I love my Vietnamese foods, especially Pho.</br> 
					I love to play computer games as part of my everyday enjoyments and listen to rap music.I am particularly interested in cybersecurity and hoping that one day I</br> 
					can design my own cybersecurity system that would provide safer and much more convenient to use. I am new to the IT world! But I have basic</br>
					computer skills like everyone else.</br>
