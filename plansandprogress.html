				<p> The project idea was developed due to our shared interest in the field of cloud computing and security. 
					Cloud storage services such as Google Drive are often used by users throughout the internet. Although most users may 
					take these services for granted, especially when they are free of charge, it has been extremely helpful for people.
					Each of us are accustomed to use cloud storage services as our main platform of working together. It occurred to us 
					that even top platforms such as Dropbox and iCloud are still prone to malicious threats. For example, around 500 
					inappropriate pictures of celebrities stored in different iCloud accounts were leaked to the internet. Dropbox’s 
					case was worse since it was reported that 68 million users’ passwords were leaked to the internet. The knowing these 
					cases’ consequences, our team realized that cloud storage services were targeting a very significant amount of users to 
					the extent that it became extremely difficult to protect massive amounts of data. It leads us to believe that our product 
					should not pursue the same strategy, instead prioritizing businesses as our main clients can increase the chances of our 
					project being successful. Technology is continually advancing at a rapid speed but even at this pace, majority of corporations
					are still struggling to protect their data. Instead of cybersecurity improving at a faster speed, hackers are finding newer 
					ways to slip through gaps that the cybersecurity industry has yet to solve.
				</p>
          			<p>	Before we began creating the software, we decided which programming languages to use for both Windows and MacOS systems. For Windows, 
					we believe using Java would be ideal because every member in our group has experience with using Java. For MacOS, we would use 
					Java as well because it is accessible in both operating systems. Once the code has been written, it can be used again for the 
					other operating system since it is an interpreted language. This eliminates the need to use Objective C for creating the MacOS 
					version of the client application. During discussions with the group members, it was believed that using Java and Objective C 
					seemed to be the best option. However, it would mean each member had to learn how to use Objective C and it would consume a lot of time.
					Due to that we changed the original idea and decided to stick with using Java only. 
				</p>
				<p> 	For the software, it has a simple user interface. When opening the software, it will ask users to login first. It will have the logo in the middle, 
					below it consisting of Email and Password with the login icon below on the left side. On the right side, it will show a sign up icon 
					that will lead to a new page if users click on it. It will require users to write down their full names, email address that is used 
					at their workplace, and name of company that they are working for. After it is completed, it will redirect them to the login page. 
					It should have a search bar on the top left, while having a small navigation bar. The navigation bar will show few options, first option 
					being “Upload File”, second would be “Create Folder”, third option being “Encrypt Files” and the last option would be “Delete Files”. 
					When users click on “Upload File”, it will open the control panel window showing documents saved in the user’s PC. After user has 
					found the file they wish to upload, they will have to simply press “Open” in the top bottom right. After the user has uploaded the file,
					the new file will show up in the home page. On the left side of the page, there will be a side navigation bar. It will first show 
					“All Files”, then “Recent”, followed by “Important”, and finally “Trash”. 
				</p>
          			<p> From our perspective, Cloud 1 should focus greatly on security protocols. Since Cloud 1 works as a private cloud storage service, the application 
					will use software as a service model for clients to use. The only way for clients to access the cloud is to download the software to use it. 
					The software will only be available for computer systems, while, it will be implemented on both Windows and MacOS. The software should run on 
					both platforms as the  majority of businesses will use either one of those operating systems. If Cloud 1 is compatible on only one operating system,  
					it will disadvantage ourselves because we would lose potential customers and it would be very tough to fend off competitors in the market. 
					Using SaaS will be more efficient for large firms because instead of having to install systems on hardware and servers, downloading the 
					software will be a lot faster. Time is money and the less time consumed on setting up the cloud storage will help save money for the firm. 
					Using SaaS for clients is considerably cheaper as well since there is no use of implementing the software into the client’s hardwares and servers. 
					It is efficient for users as well because all of their shared files can be easily uploaded. The time it takes to upload all of their files would depend 
					on their internet speed, hence if some companies have slow internet it would be time consuming especially if there are significant amount of files that are to be uploaded. 
					Smaller companies would favor this approach more mainly due to budget constraints. The total cost of using SaaS should be a lot more affordable although it is subscription based. 
				</p>
				<p> 	Cloud 1 must establish a customer service department like every other company because it is extremely important to keep customers satisfied with the product. 
					If clients have issues such as bugs appearing in the software, clients having trouble or are confused with some aspects, the solution is to contact the customer service.
					Staff who are working in this department can be software developers as well because they must have in-depth knowledge about the software and inevitable issues that would arise. 
					If staff who are responsible for customer service do not have adequate knowledge about the technical issues, fundamental information about the program, then customers 
					would not be able to solve their issues. When clients download the software, they should also be given a digital product manual in the form of a pdf file. Inside the manual, 
					it should guide users how the system works. It should include basic instructions such as how to load files to the cloud, how to create their own accounts, etc. 
					The manual should start with the fundamental instructions and eventually follows up with more advanced instructions. However, we are aware that not every user will be interested 
					in reading all of the information listed in the manual. The manual must have simple steps that are easy to read and understand to keep the reader’s attention. 
					When giving list of steps to solve an issue, it should be presented in bullet points. If the solution contains a lot of information, it will be separated into small paragraphs.
					In the menu list, it should contain a “Help” button which will lead to a new page consisting of FAQs. If users cannot find the required solution in the FAQs list, contact information
					will be listed on the bottom. Users can either contact customer service through phone calls or email.
				</p>
          			<p> 	After users can send information to the cloud storage and let the software encrypt it, the information must be copied to have backup files into a different storage. 
					This storage will only be accessible by the developers due to security reasons. It will be protected using a procedure where the software will generate new set of 
					keys that will be created randomly every 3 days. This will result in the security being a lot more challenging for unauthorised third parties to hack the system and 
					gain control over the software. If the developers lose access to the keys, they will have no other method to access the backup files thus developers must be very 
					careful to always have access to the keys while ensuring it won’t be leaked to unauthorised users. Typically the keys will be sent to their personal mobile number 
					and after they have access to the keys they will have to delete the message sent to them to prevent chances of the key being leaked. 
				</p>
				<p> 	This will apply the same for users who want to gain access to their documents if they wish to edit it. It may seem to be a hassle especially for non tech-savvy users but 
					these procedures must be followed regardless. To simplify the process, the keys will be given to employees from the technology department of each company whenever they
					need to gain access. However it will only be given to the highest positioned employee in that department, such as the project manager since the data is sensitive and 
					the user responsible for holding access must not lose it. The software should not take too much time to create the key but however it must be ensured that it does not 
					create the keys based on a pattern. It must always be completely randomized because if it shows a glimpse of a pattern or similarity between each key, hackers may notice 
					the process of how it works. Although there hasn’t been much progress on this aspect, it will be re-evaluated in the future and it must always be consistently checked on 
					to ensure there are no issues with it. If in the future the worst possibility occurs where data is leaked and stolen, there would be no other choice but to contact cyber 
					security engineers to aid us and protect whatever data is left. 
 				</p>
          			<p>  	Since the software is new, users should expect to receive a lot of patches containing updates since there is still massive amount of room for improvement. The developers would 
					not be expecting too much since users may still have few issues with how the software will run. Users can be given the option to provide feedback by contacting the developers 
					through email and writing lengthy reviews of what needs to be improved and what aspects are good. Aside from updates, troubleshooting will also be conducted frequently especially
					during updates to ensure the changes are present and users can benefit from them. The results should be documented by the team performing the troubleshoots and it will be used to
					review what aspects has been changed due to what reasons and it will be helpful in the future to learn more about what changes users want to see to make the software more usable for them.
