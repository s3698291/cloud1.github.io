					<h3> Aim </h3>
				</div>
				<div class="single-left3">
					
				<p> 	One of the most important aims of the project idea is to ensure that companies from different industries 
					can safely and confidently store their data and personal information in Cloud 1. Cloud 1 will work as a private 
					cloud because it will provide proper and better security for all of the client’s data. While ensuring that only 
					authorised users have access to the encrypted data. To achieve this aim, there are a set of goals that must be 
					achieved before this project can progress any further. The software will implement a subscription-based model 
					that consists of different plans, all varying in costs and features. Cloud security is undoubtedly one of the 
					most important aspects of the project because it reflects the purpose of the project itself. Businesses will 
					always look for new and better ways to protect their data which may contain sensitive information such as medical 
					or financial records, etc. If the cloud security can reach the standards, it will be extremely helpful for 
					businesses. In the UK alone, a staggering amount of businesses had experience with cyber-attacks and if 
					cybersecurity does not improve, Australia’s businesses might suffer the same consequences. Cloud computing is 
					advancing and becoming more important for businesses, hence why our main focus is to ensure cloud security is 
					efficient and meets the required standards to fend off against unauthorised third parties. 
 				</p>
          			<p>  The first goal is to ensure proper security of the software. Clients will have to download our software, which 
					works as a cloud storage with cloud security implemented. All of the data that is stored in the cloud will 
					be encrypted thus it may not give clients as much control over their data. The encryption key will be kept 
					within ourselves because if it is given to any unauthorised users, including the clients themselves, the data 
					can be potentially leaked to unwanted third parties. Before the data is uploaded to the cloud, the software 
					should encrypt the data first to ensure the data is safe when it is being transmitted. The software will automatically 
					create the encryption key to be held by the developers of Cloud 1. If a client wishes to retrieve back their data, a decryption 
					key will be created immediately and be given to the client. However, the decryption key will only last for 3 days and afterwards, 
					the client must use a completely different key to access the decrypted information again. The encrypted information stored in the 
					cloud can be considered as a backup because companies will definitely use more than one storage medium to store their data. 
				</p>
          			<p>  The second goal is to ensure there are enough storage space and reasonable pricing for businesses. To achieve this goal, businesses 
					will be given 2 different plans of how they wish to store their data. The first plan is having a minimum amount of 1 terabyte of 
					space, whilst the maximum is 5 terabytes in the cloud. This should be considered the bare minimum amount of data that can be 
					stored, however, it more suitable for smaller businesses that do not have massive amounts of data to be stored. For businesses 
					that choose this approach, they are able to upgrade to the remaining subscription plan. The second plan will be having 20 terabytes 
					of storage, suitable for large businesses. There can be various types of data being stored, such as word documents, spreadsheets, 
					databases, etc. It should be able to store all the necessary data files while encrypting each of them. In terms of the pricing model, 
					clients can pay monthly or yearly. 
				</p>
          			<p> 	 If clients wish to pay monthly, the first plan would cost $19.99 per month whilst the second will be charged $39.99 per month. For the second 
					pricing model, the first plan will cost $14.99 per month while the second would cost $29.99. Implementing two different pricing models 
					will be beneficial not just to Cloud 1, but to businesses as well. If some businesses have hesitations about using Cloud 1, they can 
					pay monthly first to see if Cloud 1 meets their standards. It will also be a lot easier for both parties if a business were to cancel 
					their subscription plan due to any issues. This is also a suitable approach for businesses who are new to cloud storage services since
					they are entrusting a third party, that is Cloud 1, to store and protect their data when they do not have full control over the saved data 
					in the cloud. The yearly subscription is more affordable and this may seem more appealing for any type of business. It is also the 
					better option for businesses who can trust Cloud 1 and cloud storage services in general to store their data. Psychological pricing 
					is used for the subscription plans to make it seem like an affordable service, which is very important considering the competition
					Cloud 1 may face. 
				</p>
				<p> 	Our third goal is an effective file organisation, as simple as it sounds, it is one of the important features of this project. We all want 
					to access data that is organised and structured accordingly with their respective date, time, and purpose. It is an undeniable fact 
					that most people are lazy when it comes to sorting out files. Our cloud storage will guarantee companies second to none data 
					organisational structure, for example, if a company is working on a project all their files will be saved in what we like to 
					call it workspace. Workspace records data, time and a short description of the file that has been saved, the data is then implemented 
					on a workspace timeline. When a user uploads a file, they can only have the right to view their file on the timeline, they cannot 
					access other co-worker’s data unless if a request has been sent and it has been accepted, this will guarantee safety and prevent 
					violation of others workers data due to hidden agendas. However, only the head of the department can have access to all the files 
					on the timeline and see the progress of his employee’s work. This tool will help companies save time, view progress and always stay 
					ahead of their work, as simple as it looks it is very essential and efficient for companies, especially when there is a deadline on
					a particular work.
