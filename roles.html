				<p> Although there are a variety of jobs required to complete a team to create a software, application software developers would be arguably the most important job. The software developer is responsible to help build the program and oversees the entire development of the software. Teamwork, problem solving and communication skills are the most important general skills for a software developer. The software developer will always communicate with the client who will give feedback and translate the feedback into improving the design of the software. Problem solving is essential because inevitably the process of creating the software will experience a lot of different issues. Creativity is another important skill because they are responsible for designing the entire software and ensures it can be created into what is expected. Without creativity software developers might not be able to create a practical design that can satisfy user’s needs. Analytical skills are important as well because the software developer must analyze user’s needs to ensure that all of the software’s functions are able to meet with the user’s needs. In terms of IT skills being proficient in Java language is undoubtedly the most important skill for software developers because they will be responsible for designing and creating the software. SQL is another IT related skill that is commonly sought after among software developers. To ensure that the Cloud 1 can store important and necessary information about clients, it has to be stored in a database system. Project management is a necessity since software developers will oversee the process from start until the end, although the manager will still have more control over the project. </p>
          			<p> The following role is software engineer who will work alongside with software developers as these are similar roles. The general skills that software engineers must have are very similar to software developers, although their strongest skill must be problem solving. Since software developers are in charge of designing and implementing the design into programming, the engineers will mostly focus on how to solve the issues that will come across. Communication skills is just as important since software engineers will work closely with staff from different departments. If software engineers cannot communicate well, it will be extremely hard to work together and it may cause miscommunications instead. This falls under the category of teamwork skills as well since every staff member will work in groups of different members. Troubleshooting is essential because the engineers must debug the software to ensure there are as little issues or bugs in the software when it is released to the clients. </p>
         			<p> Planning is essential because without proper plans and time management, software engineers may not meet their deadlines. In the IT industry, deadlines are a very common aspect and if engineers cannot handle it then the entire process of creating the software will become a failure. Detail-oriented is an important and shared skill among software developers and engineers since programming the codes requires them to insert the correct syntax and prevent errors. Being very knowledgeable in Java should always remain as the priority because that is where their expertise lies at. Software engineers will be responsible for most of the programming tasks. SQL programming is not as important but still necessary to help software developers create and manage their database systems that holds all of the client’s information. </p>
				<p> The last role would be cyber security engineers who will focus on creating security policies to protect the software from potential threats. Cyber security engineers must also be responsible for creating procedures that will counter threats. They are also responsible for testing the software that will encrypt and authenticate data. Their following task would be to give several attempts into hacking into the cloud to measure whether their security protocols are good enough. In terms of general skills communication skills are key because they need to continuously communicate with different staff members to avoid errors. Similar to software engineers, they must be good problem solvers. The problems that they must solve are threats that can range from simple threats to potential threats that they are yet to defend against. Teamwork skills are essential because cyber security engineers would never work together, especially when they are creating security procedures and standards to protect a significant amount of data that are sensitive, since these data belong to different companies. Analytical skills are important as well because their job is to analyze the malicious threats and figure out new methods of how to provide a solution. </p>
