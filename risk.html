					<h3> Risks </h3>

				<p> There are many different risks that need to be taken into considered when developing and launching Cloud 1 service to  the public. During development stage, our team have to ensure that Cloud 1’s security systems is the most advanced and reliable cyber-security system on the planet. Hence, our team have to take into careful considerations of determining cybersecurity companies would able to provide our standards of security, yet able to provide protection to large amount of data. Choosing a cybersecurity company and partner with is an important decision in this project, as if we chose the wrong security company, Cloud 1’s reputation will immediately go down as security is our number one priority, which differentiate us from other cybersecurity companies.  Secondly, our team has to ensure that we code Cloud 1 encryption keys appropriately and securely. This is because encryption keys act as a data backup for companies. If the coding of encryption keys are not secure and appropriately coded, clients’ data will be exposed to outside threats and hackers. Therefore, development of security systems for Cloud 1 is one of the component considered to be one of the highest risk, as our team is most likely to make mistakes in this area. A mistake during this development stage can lead to our bankrupted business. Additionally, Cloud 1 team have to make sure that we explain our security technologies work, what details and data from cloud we can see and our maintenance time. These essential information will help Cloud 1 maintains the customer’s trust as they know what information we will see and obtain and the usual maintenance time, which allows the customers to plan in advance. </p>
          			<p> When launching Cloud 1 to the public, our team have to make sure that Cloud 1 runs smoothly across all of the Window and MacOS. The likely of Cloud 1 continuously crashes on a customer’s computer is low, however, it is not impossible. If Cloud 1 crashes or the users  unable to install the software, they would likely to return to their usual cloud service provider such as Google Drive. Our proposed plan when Cloud 1 crashes on a client’s computer is that a notification will be send to our system. Our team will immediately try to find and resolve the problems. After we found out the causes, we will contact the client, apologise and invite clients to have a try again. Secondly, there is a possibility that Cloud 1 system will crash due to natural disasters or viruses enter the system. If this risk occurs, especially at the beginning state of launching, this will cause all of the encrypted data and files uploaded by customer . Consequently, Cloud 1 reputation will decrease, while creating bad first impression with potential regular clients. </p>
				<p> By approaching from a cloud user’s point of view, our team have to make sure that our design of Cloud 1 is minimalistic, easy to use. Even though the current society is an advance technologies society, where technologies are part of the daily lives. However, there are still number of people out there who is not good at using or having the current knowledge of using a particular program or new to cloud computing. Furthermore, first impression is very important component, where it will determine whether the user will continue to use the service or not to use the service. A bad first impression such as the user is unable to upload the documents due to unknown reason or they do not know how to upload the documents due to complicated design. Therefore, our team has to make sure that we design the layout and services of Cloud 1 simple enough, yet looking professional that will allow both advance technology customers and non-advance technology customers. One of main cause of a fail business is the company does not include or identify their target users or not considering enough target users to use the products or services. Hence, by designing minimalistically, Cloud 1 services are much more suitable to both type of users and overcome the risk of a failure business.  </p>
