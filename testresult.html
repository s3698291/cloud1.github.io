				<p> I have taken three different online test and they are Myers-Briggs test, online learning-style test, Five-personality test result. The result of the Myers-Briggs test is ESTJ (Extraversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judging). ESTJ personality represents “The Executive”. ESTJs are representatives of tradition and order, utilizing their understanding what is right, wrong and socially acceptable. Embracing the values of honesty, dedication and dignity, people with ESTJ personality are valued for their clear advice and guidance. ESTJs are also good as an organizer, working hard to bring people together. The result of online learning-style test describes me as a Visual Learner. That means I like kinesthetic learning and auditory learning. I like everything to do properly and in time. Five-personality test result: Neuroticism was moderate at 58%, Openness was moderate 58%, Conscientiousness was high 71%, Extraversion was moderate 48%, Agreeableness was moderate 62.5% By giving all these tests, now we know each other very well, we know where to improve. However, this is just a result, but working as a group is different and beneficial. As a group member, I have the opportunity to learn different skills from other members. </p>

				<p> After completing three online tests, I received results on my personality, learning style, and creativity. I think that these results may have a positive influence on my behaviour on the team. It can be observed from the Myers-Briggs test that I am more extroverted, which means I can communicate easily and effectively in a team. Other than that, the second test shows that I am a tactile learner. This shows that I learn things by touching and doing, this will increase the interaction between me and the team which leads to an increase in teamwork. On the last test it states that got 68/100 in the creativity test, which means I am open to creativity and will not reject or restrict any innovative solutions even if that solution is a solution that no one has tried, and I am a problem solver. </p>

				<p> The results of these studies are to show a general idea of my personality and learning styles. Based on the results I can conclude that the accuracy of the test is not the best however it is correct to a certain extent. It should be enough to show a brief perception of what my personality is like to future employers. It can also be a way to assess my personality and areas that I should work on to improve further. Since I also rely on feeling more than thinking, it will be easier for me to sympathize with other members especially when there is conflict within the team. After assessing the results based off the three tests, it may have a slight issue and disadvantage when working in a team considering that I am mostly introverted. I slowly express myself as an extrovert only to people I can consider as close friends but aside from that I find it rather difficult to immediately adapt to new surroundings. It means that it might also take some time for me to adjust and become comfortable with a new team. I am a visual learner thus it will be easier for me if my group members show me directly how something works in order to maximize the best method to learn.  </p>
				<p> When forming a team, we must ensure that everyone can co-operate and work together well. Personally, I do not have issues working with other people if we can communicate without having misunderstandings or internal conflicts with one another. Aside from that, at least one member must have good leadership skills to help lead the team. If everyone is too competitive, it will become frustrating because instead of working together to help one another, the members will instead work against each other for their personal benefit. Being someone who is prospecting (based on the Myers-Briggs test), it can be easier for other group members to work with since I can be more flexible and less pressured when unexpected issues arise. </p>
					
					<h1> Jamarl </h1>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/.jpg" alt=""width="200" height="250" /></span>
				<p> Myers-Briggs test states that my personality type is “The Consul,”A consul is a person that brings positive energy towards others, popular amongst their peers and considers as a very outgoing and socialised person. The Online learning style test indicates that I am an Auditory/Visual learner. Which means I may learn things by listening and reading or seeing pictures. I can easily store and remember information by the way it sounds, and I can understand and remember things that I see, by visualizing it in my head. The online test I chose was the Big Five Personality Test, the result I got sates that I was labelled as Extroversion, which means I am positive emotionally and I am an outgoing social person. These results indicate that when working in a team, I will get along with all my team members because I am a social person, I will be the life of the team, someone who has a positive attitude which brings up the team spirit whenever the members are feeling down. To be honest, when forming a team, I would not take these results under consideration. I believe everyone is unique in their own way, hence we all should work together despite our differences and that is what defines teamwork, different people coming together to produce something outstanding. </p>
					
					<h1> Oliver </h1>
					<span class="image main"><img src="images/.jpg" alt=""width="200" height="250" /></span>
				<p> According to the Myers-Briggs test, I am a Logistician. A logistician is someone whose works based on logic, integrity, dedication and taking responsibility to work towards a particular goal, while, following the given rules and standards. Therefore, I think my personality would help when working in the team environment as I like to ensure and keeping track of the team’s progress and making sure that we will ultimately achieve the goal at the end. The Big Five test results demonstrate that I am easily get worried about a project or able to meet and achieved the end goal. To me, there are advantages and disadvantages to this personality as I am easily get stress whenever something is not done, therefore, this could affect the teamwork and behaviours across Special 1s. The last test from: “How to Study” indicates that I am both a visual, auditory and words learner. This is where I need to actively repeat the information and draws out any relevant researches to the topic. Additionally, when I learn, I also need to construct diagrams and make relevant connections between new information and known information in order to encode the new information into my brain. </p>
									
          				<h1> Overall </h1>
				<p> Overall, there are many different personality tests available on this earth, I confidently believe that as long as each of the team members respect each other and understand that we all want to achieve the ultimate goal at our best, then we all should work hard and achieve the goal even though there are massive differences across all of the team members. </p>
