				<p> Testing phase is always done in different parts, the first being alpha testing and then followed by beta testing. Alpha testing should be conducted when the program is able to complete the basic tasks such as uploading files to the cloud server, creating folders within the cloud, etc. The prototype should not be too detailed in terms of user interface, while still missing a few aspects. For example at this stage, the cloud service may not be able to fully encrypt all of the data files that the user uploads, while it can still encrypt simple file formats such as word documents, spreadsheets, etc. During this period, feedback should focus mostly on what users think about the software, such as if it works as well as they would have expected, if there are missing features that they want to see in the software, etc. The target users will be potential customers thus we would first select random users from different companies who have expressed their interest in using the software. If we are unable to do this, we would ask family members or relatives who may have interest in using cloud services for their business.  </p>
          			<p> After the alpha testing phase will be beta testing phase where Cloud 1 is fully functional with some minor bugs that will not hinder the basic functions. We will ask a few companies interested in Cloud 1 (around 10) to use Cloud 1 for a certain period of time. The companies will receive 2 years of free subscription to Cloud 1 as payment. At the end of the beta testing phase, we will receive feedbacks from the companies and make some minor adjustments based on the feedback. The beta testing will last for at least 3 months and should not take more than 6 months. Throughout the beta testing, there will be patch files sent to the client application to ensure users can experience new updates. If users are not familiar with how updates work, there will be a step by step guide in the digital manual on how to update the software through the provided patches. After every update provided, each user must write a short but specific report regarding their opinions about the software. The users must mention which parts still requires improvement, if they noticed any improvements over the updates, aspects that they are pleased with, etc. Afterwards, each company should compile the reports given by their staff. The reports can be submitted to the cloud in the form of folders. During the beta testing, staff must also do usability testing where they should make comments about the user interface. User interface is an important aspect and it can decide whether users will continue using the software or turn away to other competitors.  </p>
