					<h1> Akash </h1>
				<p> I had a fantastic time working with group members. They all participated and contributed with their heart and soul, I think it is the most important thing. We gave each other idea to develop the project and make it better. We had several group meetings and throughout the whole project, our communication was well maintained. I am happy because everyone did their part in time and we finished our whole project before due time. And at the end I can say we had a successful project and I am looking forward to work again with Special1. </p>
					
          				<h1> Edmund </h1>
				<p> I gave my best for the assignment and I think that I performed well. The group has been performing well where most member did their work. However, one member, Oliver, did not fulfill his duty. Oliver did partial of the work that he is supposed to do and did not attend any of the group meetings or calls.  Although Oliver did not do much of the work, the work he did was fairly good and doesn’t require much editing. Because of this, me and the other members had to do his part of the assignment. Unfortunately, we were slightly off track and finished the assignment a few days later than expected but it was still before the due date. I believe that everyone gave their all when doing the assignment. Lastly, I am glad that the group was able to function properly without much difficulties and the work is completed before the submission date. </p>
					
					<h1> Jason </h1>
				<p> Nearly every group member contributed adequate amount of work towards the assignment, however one of our group members, Oliver, had only attended class once. It was difficult to communicate with him considering he rarely opened group chats and took a few days to reply to our messages. Aside from that, everyone else worked well together and it was easy for us to communicate and cooperate with one another. Most of the members were able to finish the tasks in time and we generally decided to have group meetings to discuss more regarding our project.</p>
					
					<h1> Jamarl </h1>
				<p> Overall I am pleased with all my group members, they participated very well, showing excellent team working skills and contributed great ideas towards our assignment. However one of our member, Oliver did not show up to class and group meetings due to private reasons.  </p>
					
					<h1> Oliver </h1>
				<p> Generally, each of the members of our team worked well together and everyone contributed equally. Even though i could not come to the meeting due to family reason, but I have made sure that I finished my assigned tasks and did some editing throughout the assignment. Team communication was also good but most importantly, everyone done their task and we are able to finish the project on time   </p>
					
					<h1> Overall </h1>
				<p> Although we had a bumpy start, our group managed to function without much problems and is progressing steadily. At the start of the assignment, we were discussing about our previous project idea and realized that it was somewhat hard to elaborate on it. Hence, we decided to change project idea to our current project idea. After getting through the first week and a half, we managed to gradually go gain back our momentum and started on the assignment. We held more group meetings and group calls and it led to better communication among group members. However, there was a groupmate (Oliver) that didn’t manage to attend any group meetings. The jobs were distributed equally among us. We think that we can improve on our organizing skills as the document was fairly messy and needed some improvement to make it more organized and easier for the readers. </p>
