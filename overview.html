					<h3> Overview </h3>

				<p> The purpose of our group’s project idea is to develop a cloud storage service that is targeted at businesses. 
          It will be used only by business only where they can store all their data, be it small or big. 
          Companies will be able to store and access any information they want as long as they have internet connection. 
          Because this service is targeted at businesses, we decided that security is a major problem due to the competition among businesses, competitors might hire some hackers to try and obtain or sabotage information of their rivals. 
          To make sure that does not happen, a strong and difficult to hack cybersecurity will be implemented in Cloud 1. 
          The idea of Cloud 1’s security system is inspired by Apple’s “Apple Pay”. 
          The system uses a different reference code for every transaction made, making it very secure from hackers and easy to track the activity.  </p>					
          
          
			   <p> Assuming that the project idea is successful, there will be a major impact on both small and big businesses as businesses are susceptible to information and data leak. 
             Cloud 1 will be able to help lower the risk of information leak or even prevent it, depending on the development of cybersecurity at that time. 
           Companies will be able to upload any type information onto Cloud 1 and not worry about any leaks. 
           If Cloud 1 is successful for business, it might be even use for much more sensitive matters such as  government matters. 
           For example, the government can upload the country’s financial report or military information onto Cloud 1. 
           However, this can be difficult as the technology that are currently available limits the security of Cloud 1. 
           It is also costly to maintain because money will be required to hire IT experts to maintain and update the system. </p>
          
          <p> After days of discussion, our group finally came to a conclusion and decided on this project idea because of the past years news on hackers that managed to hack into Apple’s icloud system and access sensitive material of celebrities. 
            Other than the icloud incident, there was an incident where hackers were paid by companies to hack competitors. 
            Therefore, we believe that hackers will also be able to hack into some business officials icloud and obtain information regarding their business and sell it to their competitors. 
            We hope that our project idea, Cloud 1, will be able to prevent hackers and make the industry “cleaner”. 
            This would help prevent businesses from failing or bankrupt due to information leakage. 
            Furthermore, it would be an honor if our cloud service is being recognised internationally, even in small countries. 
            Based of current IT technologies trends, it can be observed that Cloud 1 is different from most current services and trends.  </p>
          
          <p> However, there is one similar aspect, where most technology companies are trying to create better communication to connect the users and have the capacity to change how we live. 
            Cloud 1 is similar in a way that we try to establish a better and safer communication method that allow the company’s to exchange information within the hierarchy. 
            Cloud 1 will help  us to demonstrate to a future employer that our team have both essential IT skills and desired general skills. 
            We are able to do cloud computing, cybersecurity and some programming. 
            As for general skills, we have good communications, teamwork, creativity, writing and problem solving skills. </p>
          
          <p> There are currently some products that are similar to Cloud 1. 
            For example iCloud, Dropbox, ShareFile, OneDrive, Google Drive etc. 
            There will also be many competitors as well because the cloud systems are very important to have nowadays and the companies are making their own individual one. 
            But again, consumers will definitely use the safest as well as most secured one. 
            According to recent survey conducted with more than 800 business decision makers and users world-wide, the number of organizations gaining competitive advantage through high cloud adoption has almost doubled in last few years, the public cloud services market is predicted to exceed $244 Billion.  </p>
					
          <p> Cloud storage is a service where data is remotely maintained, managed and backed up.  
            Similarly by using “Cloud 1” consumers will be able to have a great communication to connect themselves with other users, store their important business documents such as transaction reports, financial documents, business letters. 
            Though there are many similar products in the market like Cloud 1, but hackers still manage to hack these applications for their own benefits. 
            Therefore, our main focus is to include different security systems to Cloud 1, which makes Cloud 1 stronger than the current, available  products. 
            Overall, our focus is  to develop a cloud computing system, Cloud 1,  by reducing the negative sides than a average, current cloud system. </p>
