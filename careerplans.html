					<h3> Career Plans </h3>

					<h1> Akash </h1>
				<p> My career plan is to be an IT analyst and it is quite offbeat to others. As the requirements of this job are different. An IT analyst also called a system analyst, design and implement information systems that optimize organizational efficiency. The process begins with managers who provide the IT analyst with a board objective, like capturing marketing research data. The initial work of an IT analyst is to provide 1st level support and customer service, able to maintain a centralized repository of documentation and process, able to diagnose the reported problem. For this job, I need job experience, excellent communication skills, good idea in Wintel, Windows, Windows desktop, Active directory, PC & phone hardware, Microsoft office. However, nowadays communication skill, teamwork and job experience are basic needs of all jobs. Because experience in working under pressure, working as a team player with communication skill makes a candidate qualified than others. In contrast, the work in the IT industry too big to finish individually. </p>
          				<h1> Edmund </h1>
				<p> My ideal job Is to be a web designer. This makes my career plan slightly different from other members of the group because the workload and requirements are different. According to the burning glass data, it shows that web designer is not a well sought-after role in the IT industry, it placed 15 out of 25. There may be some potential in this career, but it is not as much as other jobs. As a web designer, it is required to know how to code using common languages of web programming such as HTML and CSS because it is the most important skill. Furthermore, graphic design is also required as it helps to make the website more aesthetic looking and visually appealing. UX is slowly rising in popularity in what employers look for in a web designer. Since websites are supposed to be easy to use, we designers have to use their UX skill to ensure the design of the website being user-friendly. Other than IT related skills, good web designers must also have several general skills. It is common for web designers to work in teams. Therefore, teamwork, communication skills and creativity are required. Those set of skills allows the web designer to work efficiently with good communication in teams and also will be open to creative solution. Communication skill also allows the web designer to communicate efficiently with the client. </p>
					<h1> Jason </h1>
				<p> My career plan is quite different from every other member because, for my ideal job, it will be focusing on programming using Java. My career plan is to become a Java software engineer since it is highly demanded and I believe that there is a lot of potential for this job role. For software engineers being proficient at programming with Java is the most important skill. Another required skill is SQL programming which deals with database management systems. Most employers also look for candidates that are fluent in SQL considering the importance of database systems, especially for larger companies that need to store and manage large amounts of data. In terms of generic skills, problem-solving, teamwork and communication skills are undoubtedly the most important skills that any software engineer requires. It  is the fundamental skill for programming because the purpose of programming applications is to create solutions to user problems. Communication skills are just as important because software engineers will work in teams instead of doing it individually. Teamwork is just as important because it is impossible to finish tasks individually.  </p>
					<h1> Jamarl </h1>
				<p> In order for me to achieve my career plan, I will take a slightly different path compared to my group members. I will have to gain skills in both Information Technology and Management to be eligible to become an IT Operations Manager. Currently, my ideal job is ranked tenth in Information Technology jobs in Australia. Every IT department needs an Operations Manager to keep track of everything that is going on in the department and make sure everything is going well as planned, hence this is a very important role. The skills that required are, firstly specialised skills such as JAVA, Project Management, Business Management, Building Relationships, Business Analysis, Microsoft Office, data analysis.  Secondly, general skills such as Communication skills, Collaborations, Planning, Leadership, Time management and meeting deadlines. Overall to become an IT Operations Manager requires a lot of knowledge and skills in the field of IT, Business and Management, for the reason that the entire department will be counting on you to lead them and ensure that everything is going well as planned. </p>
					<h1> Oliver </h1>
				<p> My career plan is to be the leader in a cyber security team. The job requires me to have IT related skills such as security analysis. This is because it is important to understand how the security in company works to use the right strategy and tools to prevent attacks. Other than that, I will require IT project management skills. It is an IT skill that is highly demanded because as technology advances the cyber attacks advances as well, simple antivirus and filtering spam doesn’t provide much protection anymore, security solutions are now a long project that last as long as months and I need think how to implement it into the system. Just like other jobs, I will need to have some general skills as well. Because I plan to be a leader of a cyber security team, it is a must to have leadership skills to lead the group and execute task efficiently. Furthermore, I will require time management as the task could be a few months long.  I will also require good communication skills and problem solving skills as cyber security attacks are challenging. Therefore, I have to communicate properly with my group to come up with an appropriate solution. </p>
          				<h1> Overall </h1>
				<p> By comparing the career plan of every group member, it can be seen that everyone’s ideal job resides in the IT industry. There are also some similarity in the general skills required in the job, communication skill is required in everyone’s ideal job. Edmund and Jason’s ideal job were the most similar as they both require sufficient skills in programming. However, the programming languages are different as Jason is aiming to be a java programming engineer which specialises in java and Edmund is aiming to be a web designer which requires HTML, CSS and Javascript. The second pair that have similar ideal job were Oliver and Jamarl. This is because they both aspire to be a leader who leads their respective teams. In terms of IT related skill, both and Akash and Jamarl require the most IT related skill. Whereas, Jason and Oliver requires the least.   </p>
