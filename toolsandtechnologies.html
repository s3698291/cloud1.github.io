				<p> The most important tools that every member requires is a PC or laptop with adequate specifications. An ideal laptop with the proper specifications would be having at least 8 gigabytes of RAM and modern processors. Since we will be creating a software using Java, it would require laptops or PCs that can handle the minimum requirements of an integrated development environment. The main IDE that we will use to create the software will be Intellij IDE. The decision to choose Intellij IDE as our main software is due to its reputation for being the best choice among Java programmers. To ensure that our software will run smoothly without too much issues, we should be prepared to use programs that are most suitable. For most members in the group, we have the fundamental principles of Java covered, however since Akash is majoring in Mechanical Engineering, he has less experience and knowledge than us. Hence it may require more time for him to learn more about Java programming. Fortunately for the group and the clients, since the product is a software, the only hardware required are good laptops to program the software and to test it as well. The group must also have WiFi that has strong internet connection to show how well the cloud service can work. </p>
				<p> Another important tool we must have is different laptops that have MacOS and Windows implemented into it. Fortunately for us, some members have Macbooks while others have Windows laptops. Members who use Macbooks would be in charge of creating the software for MacOS, while members that use Windows laptops would do the opposite. Every member in the group is familiar with programming using Java, however in the past we have used a different IDE called Eclipse. Using Intellij IDE might take a while for each of us to get adjusted considering that both IDE has different designs. However it should not be too much of a problem especially since we are already familiar with how an IDE works. The main issue is the security aspect because none of us have adequate experience in the field of cybersecurity. Although Oliver has mentioned that he wishes to specialise in cybersecurity, he still does not have the necessary experience and knowledge that will help us reach our goals and aims. Unfortunately this is our weak point, however over time we should focus greatly on this aspect. It may mean consuming more time than we would like but the time consumed to work on this would be very vital to ensure we have reached our goals. </p>
          			<p> As for the cybersecurity part of our project idea, a simple and common yet secure security method will be used. Many systems has used the two-factor authenticator to protect users from getting hacked. It requires the user enter another code that will be sent to their emails or phone when logging in. The code generated will be a complicated alphanumeric eight digit code that is random. This provides an extra protection against password theft. Other than that, the data will be encrypted when it is travelling between the device and the server. It is protected with a TLS/SSl tunnel using 128-bits AES. It’s not the best AES encryption algorithm (there’s the AES 256-bit), but it’s safe for the foreseeable future. In simple terms, it means that when the user decides to store information onto Cloud 1, the device will connect to a proxy server and send the data to the server through the proxy server. This way there will be a lower risk of data leak. Normally, the service will keep a copy of the user's’ password  but it will mean that there is a possibility that other people will be able to access the data. To further the security, Cloud 1 employs the zero-knowledge encryption method. This means that no one excluding the user will have access for the the keys to their data, not even Cloud 1. Zero-knowledge encryption or private encryption may be a good encryption method but there are some downsides to it. Because only the user has the keys, if they forget the key, no one will be able to access the data. The data will be gone forever, trapped behind a digital wall with no method of access to get it back. Besides that, it is also slower than normal encryption. Cloud 1 will also implement a security system where the decryption key changes every 3 days. Furthermore, there is an activity log that shows what was stored, what was taken out, when and where. Both Cloud 1 and the user will have a copy of the activity log. </p>
